v0.2.3, 2021-04-20
--------------------------------
 
- Added some new features in the vasp_build module. The conventional_cell function can be used to get conventional cells (In the future, this function will be more robust in converting conventional cells)
- Added some new feature features in the external_program module. It is allowed to retrieve the original data of the band structures.
- Added some new outputs in the task summary(e.g. whether the NELM or NSW has been reached and add a parallel version of this function). 
- Fixed some bugs in the vasp_build module, making it more robust in exfoliating 2D materials.
- Fixed some bugs in the task_manager module and the vasp_plot module (e.g plot_bs function)

v0.2.2, 2021-01-16
--------------------------------
 
- Added new features in the vasp_build module (e.g. exfoliation (2D), make supercell, transformation (rotation + translation), reorientation, adding vacuum layer).
- Automatically write POTCAR according to the recommended POTCAR from the VASP manual.
- Conversion between VASP fractional and Cartesian coordinates.
- Fixed some bugs of pms module.
- Added function of "external_program" that can interact with external programs.

v0.2.1, 2020-12-09 
--------------------------------
 
- Added new features in the vasp_plot module (e.g. plot band structure and fat band).
- Added new features in the vasp_read module (e.g. read KPOINTS, EIGENVAl, PROCAR).
- Added new function of pms (project management system), which includes project_manager and task_manager. This is the prototype of automatic project and job management.
- Added new feature of writing task summary for a specific task.
- Fixed some bugs in the vasp_plot module.
- Removed some test examples.

v0.2.0, 2020-02-10 
--------------------------------
 
- Added new features in the vasp_plot module (e.g. Lorentzian broadening of the DOS curve).
- Added new features for common neighbor analysis in the vasp module.
- Added feature of labeling atom with their atom properties in the vasp_plot module. 
- Fixed some bugs in the vasp_plot module (e.g. the MatplotlibDeprecationWarning caused by fig_dos.add_subplot())
- Enable the conversion of DVM interatomic energy results to a .tex LaTeX file.
- Added frozeninfo of some transition elements in the DVM module.
- Added new tests files under the pytest framework.
- Rewrote the GUI program using PyQt5.
- Added versioning info to the matsdp.log file.
- Fixed bugs in opening empty files.

v0.1.9, 2019-11-20
-------------------------------- 

- Added the function of checking the job finished status in the vasp and the dvm module.
- Fixed some bugs in building multiple DVM jobs function in the dvm module.

v0.1.8, 2019-11-20 
-------------------------------- 
- The v0.1.7 was removed and unable to be uploaded because of the version naming problem in PyPI (Only allow to upload the same version once without minor modification).
- Some changes in the dvm module.

v0.1.6, 2019-11-10 
-------------------------------- 

- The dvm module is added
- The information of the interatomic energy can be extracted and the DVM input files can be written.

v0.1.5, 2019-11-06 
-------------------------------- 

- The dvm module is removed.
- The function of atom selection is added to the vasp_build module, which allowes the users to build the dvm model and automatically generate the *.incar file of the DVM program.

v0.1.4, 2019-11-06 
--------------------------------

- The dvm module is added, which allows the users to build the dvm model by atom selection from the POSCAR file and automatically generate the *.incar file.

v0.1.3, 2019-10-31
-------------------------------- 

- The format of the *.subst file format has been changed.
- Users can directly run the log file to get the previous results.
